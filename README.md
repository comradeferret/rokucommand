 Keypresses are typed as-is, and include:
 "Home" "Rev" "Fwd" "Play" "Select" "Left" "Right" "Down" "Up" "Back" "InstantReplay" "Info" "Backspace" rch" "Enter" "VolumeDown" "VolumeUp" "VolumeMute" "PowerOff" "PowerOn" "ChannelUp" "ChannelDown" "InputTuner" utHDMI1" "InputHDMI2" "InputHDMI3" "InputHDMI4" "InputAV1"

 * Keypresses can be repeated quickly by appending a number, ie `left 5`

 Use "launch" to launch or install an app either by name or by APP_ID.  Names are taken from "Roku Apps.txt" he same folder.  ie. `launch youtube`

Inputs that are not keypresses or apps will be automatically interpreted as text, and typed â€” ie, for a streaming service\'s search engine.
